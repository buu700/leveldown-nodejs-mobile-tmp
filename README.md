# leveldown-nodejs-mobile

Fork of [leveldown](https://github.com/Level/leveldown) that is committed to support [nodejs-mobile](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile) because leveldown [not necessarily supports](https://github.com/Level/leveldown/issues/575) it.

## Supports

- Version 5.4.1, 5.1.1
- Android
- iOS

## Diff

The changes made from leveldown to leveldown-nodejs-mobile are:

- Using `bindings` instead of `node-gyp-build` to load the native bindings

## Versioning

We will follow the convention of having the same SemVer code as the official leveldown, but with a suffix `-X` (where `X` is a number). For instance, `leveldown-nodejs-mobile@5.1.1-3` is the `3`rd version of this library that is equivalent to `leveldown@5.1.1`.
